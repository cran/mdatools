\title{Normalization}
\usage{
prep.norm(data, type = "area", col.ind = NULL, ref.spectrum = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a matrix with data values}

\item{type}{type of normalization \code{"area"}, \code{"length"}, \code{"sum"}, \code{"snv"}, \code{"is"}, or \code{"pqn"}.}

\item{col.ind}{indices of columns (can be either integer or logical valuws) for normalization to internal
standard peak.}

\item{ref.spectrum}{reference spectrum for PQN normalization, if not provided a mean spectrum for data is used}
}
\value{
data matrix with normalized values
}
\description{
Normalizes signals (rows of data matrix).
}
\details{
The \code{"area"}, \code{"length"}, \code{"sum"} types do preprocessing to unit area (sum of
absolute values), length or sum of all values in every row of data matrix. Type \code{"snv"}
does the Standard Normal Variate normalization, similar to \code{\link{prep.snv}}. Type
\code{"is"} does the normalization to internal standard peak, whose position is defined by
parameter `col.ind`. If the position is a single value, the rows are normalized to the height
of this peak. If `col.ind` points on several adjucent vales, the rows are normalized to the area
under the peak - sum of the intensities.

The \code{"pqn"} is Probabilistic Quotient Normalization as described in [1]. In this case you also
need to provide a reference spectrum (e.g. mean or median of spectra for some reference samples). If
reference spectrum is not provided it will be computed as mean of the spectra to be
preprocessed (parameter \code{data}).
